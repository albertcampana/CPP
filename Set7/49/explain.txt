Exercise 49:

We are required to convert time specification to a fine-grained time specification and vice-versa. 
To do this we make use of the duration_cast implemented in the chrono library. And then for the seconds to minutes, we make use of the duration function. 
Finally, we print both the hours to minutes and the seconds to minutes.
