 Just one Vtable is created for each class that has virtual methods and it is shared by all objects of that class. Having each one Vpointer to the corresponding Vtable.
 
 This program defines two Vtables, one for Base and one for Derived and two Vpointer one for base and one for derived objects. 
 
 The message object created using the derived object uses the derived Vtable even though it has a base poiter. This is possible because of polymorphism.
