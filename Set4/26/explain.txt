In this exercise we are required to define classes having Vtables whose objects can safely be destroyed. 

We had to add a virtual destructor to the Base class to delete all the pointers, because we have pointers to Base objects, but they contain Derived objects.
Making it virtual, updates the vtable of the object so when you call delete, the correct destructor is executed.
