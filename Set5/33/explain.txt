In this exercise we are required to print the word and how many times has this word appeared in the input.

To solve this exercise we decide to use a map as it stores unique key in an ordered way. So using each string as the key and the value is an int representing how many times it has appeared. We increment this int for every word that appears in the input.

The code is so simple because in a map every new key is auto-initialized to a default value. In our int case, it is initialized to 0.

Using the input: a a a b c abc acb acb ab ac 
We get the output on file out1.txt
