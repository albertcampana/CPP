In this exercise we were required to change the Strings class so that:
copy- and move-constructors, assignment operators and destructor are available without 
us having to implement or declare them.

We did it by inheriting from vector, as opposed to the first implementationn, where we had vector<string> d_str member and multiple unnecessary inline functions wrapping those already available in vector.
