In this question we are asked to create a program that prints a sorted list of all the different words appearing in the input.

We used a set to solve this exercise. It automatically sorts the words, but it does not differentiate between the new ones or the ones that already appeared.
To solve that issue we put all the words inside a map and print the map.
